# Image Encryption System

The **Image Encryption System** provides a simple yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel-level manipulation. The system leverages RGB channel swapping for encryption and decryption, ensuring the original image can be restored accurately.

---

## Features

- **Encryption**: Secures an image by altering its RGB channels.
- **Decryption**: Restores the original image by reversing the channel manipulation.
- **Lightweight**: Built using the Pillow library for efficient image processing.
- **Testable**: Includes comprehensive unit tests with pytest for reliability.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Programmatic Use

Import the `ImageCrypto` class to integrate encryption and decryption into your own Python scripts:

```python
from src.image_crypto import ImageCrypto

# Encrypt an image
ImageCrypto.encrypt_image("input.png", "encrypted.png")

# Decrypt an image
ImageCrypto.decrypt_image("encrypted.png", "decrypted.png")
```

### Demo Script

Run the interactive demo script to see the encryption and decryption process in action:

```bash
python examples/demo.py
```

---
