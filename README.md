# Image Encryption System

A secure and efficient image encryption system that manipulates pixel data by swapping RGB channels. This library provides functionality to encrypt and decrypt images, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of visual data.

---

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts an image by swapping its RGB channels.
- **Decryption**: Restores the original image by reversing the channel swap.
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use methods for image encryption and decryption.
- **Format Support**: Compatible with a variety of image formats using the `Pillow` library.

## Setup

To set up the environment and install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-encryption-system.git
   cd image-encryption-system
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

The library provides two main functions: `encrypt_image` and `decrypt_image`. Here's how you can use them:

### Example Code

```python
from src.image_crypto import ImageCrypto

# Initialize the ImageCrypto class
crypto = ImageCrypto()

# Encrypt an image
crypto.encrypt_image("input.png", "encrypted.png")
print("Image successfully encrypted!")

# Decrypt the image
crypto.decrypt_image("encrypted.png", "decrypted.png")
print("Image successfully decrypted!")
```

---

## Examples

A demonstration script is available in the `examples/` directory. To try it out:

1. Navigate to the `examples` directory:
   ```bash
   cd examples
   ```

2. Run the demo script:
   ```bash
   python demo.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt and decrypt an image.

Sample input image: `examples/test_image.png`.

---

## Testing

The `tests/` directory contains unit tests for verifying the functionality of the library.

To run the tests, use:

```bash
pytest
```

Ensure that all tests pass successfully.
